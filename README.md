# Smoothy

## What is Smoothy?
Smoothy is a discord bot designed for playing Twitch streams in a discord server.

## Credit
This bot was created using the library discord.py, along with discord.py's documentation. 
This library is required if you intend to use this bot on your local machine.

## Fair Use
Please feel free to download the code and run this discord bot on your own
local machine. Do, however, note that your local machine must act as a server
for this bot (the script must be actively running on your machine). I intend
to create a custom server on a Raspberry Pi, and I won't hesitate to make 
a guide once I do so.
